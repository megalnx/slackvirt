Slackware qemu system

Slackware64-14.2
RAM: 4GB
DISK: 15GB

The system requires about 7.0GB of storage, but is recommended to use a 15GB if
you wish to save virtual machine states using libvirt.

It is required about 1.4GB of temporary files for building QEMU (qemu-4.1.0). 
You can increase the size of your /tmp folder using the following command:
# mount -o remount,size=1400M /tmp
or with TARGETS=all about 2.7GB
# mount -o remount,size=2700M /tmp
